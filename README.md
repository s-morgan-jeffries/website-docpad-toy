# [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) skeleton for [DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad)

A clean responsive template that you may like as a quick and pretty clean setup that includes both a homepage, some pages and a blog. 

Contenttypes: 

* pages
* posts
* faqentries

These may help to quickly come to grips with how easy it is to create and [query](http://bevry.me/learn/queryengine-guide) collection-types and basically how to get a good information architecture up. All credits to [DocPad](http://http://docpad.org/) that makes all this stuff extremely simple to do.
