**The below is an excerpt of the README.md as found in the master-branch.**

A clean simple template that contains a logical setup for a website + blog.

## Getting Started

1. [Install DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad)

2. Because this template uses [docpad-plugin-sass](https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-sass) here's some needed stuff:
    1. [Install Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
    2. [Install the Sass Gem] (http://rubygems.org/gems/sass/)
    3. [Install Bourbon Gem](http://bourbon.io/)  A simple and lightweight mixin library for Sass

3. This template also uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to do some of it's build-tasks, such as minification. So you need to:
    1.[Install Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)

4. Clone the project and run the server

    ``` bash
    git clone git://github.com/clearskyabove/zurb-foundation.docpad.git
    cd zurb-foundation.docpad
    npm install && bourbon install
    docpad run
    ```

5. [Open http://localhost:9778/](http://localhost:9778/)

6. Start hacking away by modifying the `src` directory

7. Already installed [docpages-plugin-ghpages](https://github.com/docpad/docpad-plugin-ghpages) for easy publishing to github pages. See the link for how to publish.
