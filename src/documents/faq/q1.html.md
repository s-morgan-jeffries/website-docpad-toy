You may like it as a quick and pretty clean setup that includes both a homepage, some pages and a blog. 

A lot of templates out there only cover a simple blog setup, but we needed a website + blog setup. 
If you want this as well, this template may help.

Lastly, we added three different contenttypes: 

* pages
* posts
* faqentries

These may help to quickly come to grips with how easy it is to create and [query](http://bevry.me/learn/queryengine-guide) collection-types and basically how to get a good architecture up. All credits to [DocPad](http://http://docpad.org/) that makes it extremely simple to get going.
